# 💫 About Me:
👋 Hi, This is Surya Manohar<br>I'm an Electronics & Communication Engineering student at IIIT Nagpur, passionate about building hardware that matters—from FPGA-powered signal processors to RF energy-harvesting IoT systems. My work blends Verilog-based digital design, embedded systems, and low-power wireless communication for real-world applications like smart agriculture and assistive technology.<br>I enjoy creating solutions that sit at the edge of innovation and utility—Let's connect if you're into silicon, sensors, or signal processing!<br><br>🔭 I’m currently working on<br>An RF Energy Harvesting and LoRaWAN Communication System for smart agriculture, which enables remote sensor monitoring over 10 km using harvested energy.<br><br>Several FPGA-based systems using Verilog including an audio equalizer and assistive control interface for quadriplegic patients.<br><br>🌱 I’m currently learning<br>Advanced FPGA design techniques (timing closure, signal stability optimization), VHDL and MATLAB.<br><br>Real-time embedded systems and low-power communication protocols.<br><br>👯 I’m looking to collaborate on<br>FPGA/Verilog based hardware design and internships in VLSI domain..<br><br>Embedded systems involving IoT, sensor interfacing, or RF communication.<br><br>🤔 I’m looking for help with<br>Seeking Internships in Semiconductor Domain and some hardware related projects..<br><br>Improving my knowledge about semiconductors and working with them, most importantly to pursue a career in VLSI domain..<br><br>💬 Ask me about<br>Verilog/SystemVerilog, MATLAB, LoRaWAN, C/C++, Arduino, ESP32,FPGA development (Vivado, BASYS3/Nexys A7).<br><br>Sensor-based embedded systems and signal processing on FPGAs.<br><br>📫 How to reach me<br>Email: suryamanohar2211@gmail.com<br>LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/surya-manohar<br>GitHub: github.com/surya2211-hacker<br><br>⚡ Fun fact<br>I treat Vivado like others treat video games—I build, debug, simulate, and celebrate when it compiles without errors.
